- [ ] Add proper audio and game sound
- [ ] Improve enemy movement towards player
- [ ] Change speed of ammo
- [ ] Change speed of laser power
- [ ] Make weapon spawned on the map bigger

Features:

MAYBE
- [ ] Check why despawn of enemy/ammo is getting WARNING
- [ ] Limit spawn of bullets to not be too close
- [ ] (Maybe) Remove source and ammo_source from WeaponType struct
- [ ] (Maybe) Change collision from capsule to Ammo and Weapon sizes
- [ ] Add information about next wave (and some pause maybe)
- [ ] (Maybe) Maybe despawn shields when they hit opponent

HISTORY:
When you finish, it says: "You're half done"
So you start with left half, then second campaign right half and then finally third campaign
you're whole, but you still have to fight the US boss to go home.
